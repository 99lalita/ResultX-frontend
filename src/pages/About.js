              <p className="section-3-p">
                In the summer of 2022, a small group of passionate educators and
                tech enthusiasts came together with a shared vision: to
                revolutionize the way students and teachers interact with
                academic results. Frustrated by the outdated, inefficient
                systems that were prevalent in educational institutions, we knew
                there had to be a better way.
              </p>
              <p className="section-3-p">
                We started in a modest garage, brainstorming and sketching out
                ideas late into the night. With a clear goal and an unwavering
                commitment, we transformed those ideas into a robust platform.
                This is how ResultX was born‚Äîa result of hard work, dedication,
                and a belief in the power of technology to improve education.
